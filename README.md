Easy Proximity-based Sharing for iOS - DEMO APP FOR SWIFT BRIDGING

Perfect for any iOS app that needs to quickly share items with nearby friends, such as groups, photo albums, photos, links, user profiles, etc, using Bluetooth Low Energy.

Users simply click "find nearby", and items from their friends' phones magically pop up on their screen for them to add with one tap.
